# Contract

* We will respect each others' time, effort and wellbeing. We will communicate effectively and early. Put in the necessary effort to accomplish what we set out to, but also not be afraid to reach out for help, nor to give it.
* If someone on our team breaks one or more of our rules, the team may have a meeting and ask the person to follow our agreement. If the person still breaks the rules, we will ask our teacher to help find a solution.

* Signed: Tyler Jang, Maverick Chung, Andrew Krier, Sarah Gregorich, Marisuz Derezinski-Choo
