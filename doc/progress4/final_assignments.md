# Final Assignments

A list of all the things that need to be completed for those taking the class pass/fail.

- README.md
- Design doc
- API_Changes doc
- Example games
- Example styling (ish)
- Analysis
- Live Demo (ish)
- Bug Fixes if necessary

### README.md

Finish it up.

### [DESIGN.md](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci308/spring20/assign/documentation/readme.php#DESIGN)

THIS IS DUE BEFORE OUR DEMO ON TUESDAY!

- All names
- All roles
- Project's design goals
- Extensibility for new features
- High-level design
- Assumptions or decisions to simplify design
- Describe details for adding new features (and new data)

### API_CHANGES.md

THIS IS DUE BEFORE OUR DEMO ON TUESDAY!

Changes to API

### Example Games

I THINK THIS IS STILL REQUIRED:

For each of the three games (two different games, one as a mod), create a 1-2 minute video of playing the game with voice over.

Each person must make a smaller individual game variation for the Analysis.

### Example Styling

We should probably add 1-2 more styling themes.

### [Analysis](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci308/spring20/assign/04_final/part6.php)

PROFESSOR DUVALL NOTED THAT THIS IS NOT REQUIRED UNLESS YOU HAVE A C OR WORSE GRADE ESTIMATE.

- Documentation (individually in analysis_NETID and then merge request to master but don't accept)
- [Team Project Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIdx4Mv9p8JrRcdvnA-35rN0PKvFAise88b5Am_n2Cyer6qA/viewform)
- Game per person (see Example Games) (in your portfolio in analysis_NETID)
- Design Review (04_final/ANALYSIS.md) (in your portfolio in analysis_NETID)
- Code Masterpiece (in your portfolio in analysis_NETID)
